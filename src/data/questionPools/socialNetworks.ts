      'By measuring changes in individuals’ behaviors or states *after* new connections are formed or existing connections change, controlling for prior similarity.',

    explanation: 'Longitudinal data allows researchers to see if changes in network ties precede changes in behavior. Statistical methods can then attempt to disentangle whether connections cause behavior change (influence) or similar behaviors cause connection formation (homophily).',
